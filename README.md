The Programming Language Is Designed To Improve Performance And Reduce The Size Of The Code.

Hi! This Is The First Version Of The Language That Complements The Python Language! Note In Advance That This Is Not A Language That Doesn't Have Variables And Functions! It's All There In Python, Use It All In Python, But There's No Such Thing Here. Why? Since This Is A Great Addition To The Language, It Does Less Code, And Also Has More Than 50 Features, Even More, And Also Note That This Is Only The First Version Of This "Language", So Keep That In Mind. And Yes, I Am A Novice Programmer. And Now Let's Move On To The Comparisons And Documentation! Also, My English Is Bad...

```python
print("Hello world!")
print("Soon here will be content!")
```
